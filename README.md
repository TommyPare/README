## About Me 
Hey, Iâ€™m Tommy Pare. I'm from Montreal, Canada. I am a Business Analyst, working for one of the biggest companies in Canada and I'm a self-taught full-stack developer. I started out learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and SQL. I am currently working on my portfolio in order to start freelancing web development projects. You can find previous projects of mine under the "Repositories" tab and you'll be able to find all of my future projects there, aswell. Feel free to follow me or reach out to me regarding questions, feedback, criticism (which is much appreciated) and/or job offers.
